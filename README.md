# HW11_JavaScript_DomManipulation

This assignment includes the following elementts needed for this assignment.  

Static Folder Files:

js
1.  data.js - data file
2.  app.js - code file
3.  index.html - web code

Couple of Items to Note:
1.  Fed in a data reader to take in multiple date types and return the same data.
2.  Added an enter function, mostly because it was driving me personally crazy that I coudl not just hit enter after I put in the date and had to click on the filter button.
